            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Blend your tomatoes, scotch bonnet, and <em>tatashe</em> together.</li>
                <li>Put your rice into a bowl and soak with hot water: <br>
                    Allow this to soak for 10-15 minutes. Then, wash with warm water and keep aside, or parboil your rice and wash. 
                    <br>This is important as you will get rid of excess starch in the rice.
                </li>
                <li>Heat up your oil: <br>
                    Put your oil in a pot and allow it to heat up.</li>
                <li>Add your chopped onions and allow them to fry. <br>
                    Be sure to keep the onions from burning in the process.
                </li>
                <li>Add and fry your blended ingredients and purée: <br>
                    Allow them to fry until you get rid of the sour taste (about 10-15 minutes).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add your maggi, garlic, ginger, curry, thyme and salt: <br>
                    Mix it all together. Be careful with your maggi as you do not want it too salty (2 maggi cubes for a cup of rice). <br> 
                    Add your stock or water, and mix too. Taste to adjust to any seasoning
                </li>
                <li>Pour your rice into the pot and mix together: <br>
                    Make sure it is covered in the tomato sauce.
                </li>
                <li>Cook on low medium heat: <br>
                    Check your rice after at least 10 minutes, using a wooden spatula to dip into the rice. This helps with getting the sauce to get the bottom of the pot, <br>
                    so that it does not start burning when the rice is not cooked.
                </li>
                <li>Cook until soft:<br>
                    Do not overcook your rice or get your rice too soggy. When rice is soft, lower the heat and allow to simmer so <br> 
                    the water will get completely dry.</li>
                <li>Serve the rice: <br>
                    Serve with fried plantain and your choice of meat, if desired.
                </li>
