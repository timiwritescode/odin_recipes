Simple recipes web page with 'The Odin project'

This is all part of the learning journey and by the end of this,
I'll have learned:
- how to use git and github for version control
- how to create simple webpage with html
- maybe how to actualize one of the recipes here, lol.

The fruit punch recipe was sourced from https://www.nigerianlazychef.com/2015/07/hibiscus-and-fruit-punch-zobo/
